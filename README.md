# 🐼 Pandas Project Labs

This repository contains three data analysis labs focused on real-world datasets. All projects are implemented using Python and `pandas` in Jupyter Notebooks, and include both code and business-oriented markdown summaries.

## 🔍 Overview

Each notebook walks through:
- Dataset exploration
- Cleaning and handling missing values
- Grouping and aggregating data
- Drawing conclusions based on descriptive statistics

These labs were completed as part of a practical learning journey in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and business data interpretation.
